# Engineer's Log

Similar to a Captian's log, this will contain my thoughts, learnings, and experiences.

Rationale: This is my first deep dive into k8s + helm to package and run applications. I am also learning to use ChatGPT to boost my productivity. There's a lot of learning going on, so I want to capture and share. This may be adapted to a blog post in the future.

Project inception (give or take a few days)

Initially I wanted to make this a quick-and-easy example of low-code tooling for making a vinyl library + API/database integration. I had a few screening calls that wanted to see K8s experience, so I decided to branch out and use k8s with `kind` and `helm` for local development.

This ambition has been boosted by ChatGPT, which is enabling me to provide better documentation with much less effort; template files, etc.

I stood up & dockerized a `FastAPI` server in Python; this will eventually be used to integrate with ChatGPT to generate record descriptions.

The README is nearly entirely driven by ChatGPT with additional edits and sylistic changes. This file reflects my experience and learnings, and thus has not been generated by an AI (yet?).

Ok, getting into helm charts, and creating a k8s cluster.
- The cluster exists independently of the helm implementation
    - ~~TODO: write a script checking for kind cluster~~
- Learning to package helm charts.... this is a little more than I realized. Feeling a sense of humility. I thought my experience in Docker orchestration with Fargate & docker-compose would translate a little more directly. Back to K8s docs and building from the ground up.
- Ok this is interesting: `helm` charts simply configure k8s with a consistent format driven by Go templates. Much simpler than it looked from a distance.
- Continuing to learn about k8s and the `kubectl` commands. It's interesting, definitely elegant but rather complex.

While trying to follow the vanilla k8s instructions at [appsmith](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/kubernetes) I keep encountering an `ImagePullBackOff` error. I created a docker login to see if that will help. It didn't...

I ended up editing the `values.yml` file and updating it to only pull on command. This worked well, then I learned about `kubectl` port-forward and everything makes sense finally.

I got `appsmith` up and running; now I want to figure out how to extend the chart to add my own resources in k8s and then repackage that... Anyways, major progress on k8s today.

I spent some time reading up on storage persistence on k8s. I don't quite grok it yet but I'm trying to be patient. How do I backup/persist volumes mapped to containers? It looks like k8s has a different abstraction. Sure enough, hitting the docs:

> Storage orchestration Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.

[source](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/#why-you-need-kubernetes-and-what-can-it-do)

I asked ChatGPT and it looks like there's a k8s API for creating a configMap or secret. Learning a lot here.

To focus on getting an operational POC (before configuring persistent storage), I changed gears to get the `appsmith` install working via a local chart config.

I thought I would be able to build the container I want to serve locally, but it looks like there are some extra steps using [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/local-registry/). Or I could use `kind load docker-image` [per this](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#loading-an-image-into-your-cluster). Since I only need to work with the one API image I think it will be easy enough to make a build & load script. This was a bit of a tangential learning curve, though!

I managed to get the API running via helm install with:
```
$ docker build -t low-code-vinyl-api vinyl_api
$ kind load docker-image low-code-vinyl-api --name low-code-vinyl
```

Then, I can run the helm charts against the cluster with:
```
$ helm install low-code-vinyl helm
$ kubectl port-forward "$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=low-code-vinyl,app.kubernetes.io/instance=low-code-vinyl" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")" 8080:8000
```

I'm able to see that the API works when navigating to http://localhost:8080!
