# Engineer's Log

Similar to a Captian's log, this will contain my thoughts, learnings, and experiences.

Rationale: This is my first deep dive into k8s + helm to package and run applications. I am also learning to use ChatGPT to boost my productivity. There's a lot of learning going on, so I want to capture and share. This may be adapted to a blog post in the future.

Project inception (give or take a few days)

Initially I wanted to make this a quick-and-easy example of low-code tooling for making a vinyl library + API/database integration. I had a few screening calls that wanted to see K8s experience, so I decided to branch out and use k8s with `kind` and `helm` for local development.

This ambition has been boosted by ChatGPT, which is enabling me to provide better documentation with much less effort; template files, etc.

I stood up & dockerized a `FastAPI` server in Python; this will eventually be used to integrate with ChatGPT to generate record descriptions.

The README is nearly entirely driven by ChatGPT with additional edits and sylistic changes. This file reflects my experience and learnings, and thus has not been generated by an AI (yet?).

Ok, getting into helm charts, and creating a k8s cluster.
- The cluster exists independently of the helm implementation
    - ~~TODO: write a script checking for kind cluster~~
- Learning to package helm charts.... this is a little more than I realized. Feeling a sense of humility. I thought my experience in Docker orchestration with Fargate & docker-compose would translate a little more directly. Back to K8s docs and building from the ground up.
- Ok this is interesting: `helm` charts simply configure k8s with a consistent format driven by Go templates. Much simpler than it looked from a distance.
- Continuing to learn about k8s and the `kubectl` commands. It's interesting, definitely elegant but rather complex.

While trying to follow the vanilla k8s instructions at [appsmith](https://docs.appsmith.com/getting-started/setup/installation-guides/kubernetes) I keep encountering an `ImagePullBackOff` error. I created a docker login to see if that will help. It didn't...

I ended up editing the `values.yml` file and updating it to only pull on command. This worked well, then I learned about `kubectl` port-forward and everything makes sense finally.

I got `appsmith` up and running; now I want to figure out how to extend the chart to add my own resources in k8s and then repackage that... Anyways, major progress on k8s today.
